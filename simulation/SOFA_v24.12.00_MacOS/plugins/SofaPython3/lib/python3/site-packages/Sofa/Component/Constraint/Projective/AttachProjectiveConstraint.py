           clamp (bool):   true to clamp particles at lastPos instead of freeing them.
           componentState (object):   The state of the component among (Dirty, Valid, Undefined, Loading, Invalid).

           endTime (float):   The constraint stops acting after the given value.
Use a negative value for infinite constraints
           freeRotations (bool):   true to keep rotations free (only used for Rigid DOFs)
           group (int):   ID of the group containing this constraint. This ID is used to specify which constraints are solved by which solver, by specifying in each solver which groups of constraints it should handle.
           indices1 (TypeHints.SofaArray):   Indices of the source points on the first model
           indices2 (TypeHints.SofaArray):   Indices of the fixed points on the second model
           lastDir (TypeHints.SofaArray):   direction from lastPos at which the attach coustraint should become inactive
           lastFreeRotation (bool):   true to keep rotation of the last attached point free (only used for Rigid DOFs)
           lastPos (TypeHints.SofaArray):   position at which the attach constraint should become inactive
           listening (bool):   if true, handle the events, otherwise ignore the events
           minDistance (float):   the constraint become inactive if the distance between the points attached is bigger than minDistance.
           name (str):   object name
           positionFactor (float):   IN: Factor applied to projection of position
           printLog (bool):   if true, emits extra messages at runtime.
           responseFactor (float):   IN: Factor applied to projection of force/acceleration
           restRotations (bool):   true to use rest rotations local offsets (only used for Rigid DOFs)
           tags (object):   list of the subsets the object belongs to
           twoWay (bool):   if true, projects the constraint vertices of both object1 and object2 towards their average degrees of freedom and derivatives. If false, the position of the object1 are projected onto the object2. Therefore, object2 only follows object1 without affecting the motion of object1
           velocityFactor (float):   IN: Factor applied to projection of velocity
